# Crypto Portfolio Tracking

I don't like uploading all my addresses to a website and trust it to track my balances ðŸ«¤
Thus, this is an easy command line tool for you to just fill in addresses and rpcs and track your crypto balances on your own end ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage

1. Rename `constant_example.rs` to `constant.rs`. Once this is done, the code can be run!

2. `cargo run`

3. Fill in your addresses and rpcs in `constant.rs`; currently only ETH and OP are supported but more networks can be added following how `ETH_RPC` & `OP_RPC` are added in `main.rs`
